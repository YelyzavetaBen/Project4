<h2>Goal</h2>
The primary objective of this project is to accurately forecast future life expectancy trends using exponential smoothing techniques. By leveraging historical life expectancy data, the project aims to develop a robust predictive model


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves a detailed examination of Uber pick-up data across different timescalesâ€”monthly, weekly, and hourly. By analyzing data from various New York City bases, the project aims to identify demand trends and their implications for Uber's service strategies. Key focus areas include assessing monthly demand fluctuations, weekday and hourly pick-up patterns, and the distribution of active vehicles across Uber bases. The insights derived will guide Uber in enhancing resource allocation, adjusting surge pricing, and improving overall customer satisfaction.


<h2>Skills</h2>

- Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare Uber datasets for analysis.
- Advanced data visualization to represent complex relationships in the data.
- Statistical analysis to identify significant trends and anomalies.
- Temporal data analysis for understanding patterns over different times of day and days of the week.
- Geographic data analysis to pinpoint high-demand areas.
- Hypothesis testing to validate observed patterns and their significance.

<h2>Technology</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 
- <b>Pandas</b>
- <b>Seaborn</b> 
- <b>Matplotlib</b>
- <b>Plotly</b>
- <b>Folium</b>


<h2>Results</h2>
The exploratory data analysis of the Uber dataset yielded significant insights into riding patterns and demand cycles in New York City, emphasizing the importance of strategic resource management:

- <b>Monthly Trends:</b> June was identified as the peak month for Uber pickups, likely due to seasonal activities and tourist influx, indicating the need for increased fleet availability during this period.
- <b>Weekly and Daily Patterns:</b> Analysis revealed that Fridays and Saturdays consistently experience higher demand, especially during evening hours. This trend underscores the importance of strategically increasing fleet availability on these days to accommodate nightlife and recreational travel.
- <b>Hourly Fluctuations:</b> There is a clear distinction in hourly demand between weekdays and weekends. Peak hours during weekdays are typically during morning and evening rush hours, while weekends show a spread in high demand across the evening. This necessitates different operational strategies for weekdays versus weekends.
- <b>Geographic Insights:</b> Midtown Manhattan emerged as a critical hotspot for pickups, with significant activity extending to Lower and Upper Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn. These insights can guide targeted marketing and real-time dynamic pricing strategies.
- <b>Fleet Distribution:</b> The base with the most active vehicles was identified, providing an opportunity to optimize vehicle deployment across less active but high-demand areas to balance supply and enhance service responsiveness.
