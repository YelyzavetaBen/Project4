<h1><a href="https://github.com/YelyzavetaBen/Project4/blob/main/life%20expectancy.ipynb">Forecasting life expectancy data with Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA models</a></h1>
<h2>Goal</h2>
The primary objective of this project is to accurately forecast future life expectancy trends using Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA models. By leveraging historical life expectancy data, the project aims to develop a robust predictive model.


<h2>Description</h2>
This project aims to forecast future life expectancy trends by employing two prominent time series forecasting techniques: Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models. Leveraging historical life expectancy data, the project seeks to develop accurate and reliable predictive models capable of capturing the underlying patterns and trends in life expectancy.


<h2>Skills</h2>

- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Advanced data visualization to represent complex relationships in the data.
- Model Development:
- Exponential Smoothing: Various exponential smoothing methods, such as Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holtâ€™s Linear Trend Model, and Holt-Winters Seasonal Model, will be implemented and fine-tuned. These models are well-suited for capturing underlying trends and seasonal variations in time series data.
- ARIMA Models: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models will be developed to capture the linear dependencies and temporal structure of the life expectancy data. The ARIMA framework involves identifying the appropriate orders of autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) components.
- Model Evaluation: The performance of both Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA models will be rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and forecast accuracy measures. This evaluation will provide insights into the effectiveness of each modeling approach in forecasting life expectancy.
- Forecasting and Interpretation: Using the developed models, future life expectancy trends will be forecasted for the desired time horizon. These forecasts will be interpreted to provide actionable insights and recommendations for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and stakeholders involved in public health initiatives.

<h2>Results</h2>
Using the developed models, we generated life expectancy forecasts for the next 8 years for various countries. These forecasts revealed a continued improvement in life expectancy, reflecting ongoing advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions. The forecasts offer valuable insights that can inform policy and planning at national and international levels
